### 📂 Featured Projects

#### 1. AI Network Traffic Classification & Anomaly Detection System
* **Context:** Computing Technology Innovation Project (Grade: 95% High Distinction)
* **Goal:** Designed an ML-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of multi-class known attack classification and real-world anomaly detection.
* **Tech & Architecture:** Random Forest, MLP, custom PyTorch Deep Neural Network, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, FastAPI, D3.js, Plotly.
* **Outcomes:** Achieved ~95% classification accuracy and detection latency under 200ms. Reduced undetected DDoS exposure by 95% in simulated environments.

#### 2. Real-Time Machine Learning Models for Predicting Traffic Conditions
* **Goal:** Designed a real-time ML forecasting system to predict short-term traffic conditions using VicRoads SCATS sensor data.
* **Tech & Architecture:** LSTM, GRU, TCN, Dash, Flask, Plotly. Built a robust data engineering pipeline for cleaning and sequence windowing.
* **Outcomes:** ~30% performance improvement after pipeline optimization. Integrated the predictive system into a real-time dashboard with geospatial mapping.

#### 3. Machine Vision OCR System
* **Goal:** Built a custom deep learning OCR system from scratch for handwritten character detection, expanding from MNIST digits to EMNIST (letters + digits).
* **Tech & Architecture:** Custom CNN, Flask API backend, HTML5 canvas/JavaScript frontend, Docker.
* **Outcomes:** 98% accuracy on MNIST and real-time inference under 200ms. Containerized the entire application for reproducible production-style deployment.

#### 4. Archery Enterprise Database System
* **Goal:** Designed a fully normalized operational relational database (3NF) and a separate analytical schema (Snowflake model) for an archery enterprise.
* **Tech & Concepts:** SQL, referential integrity enforcement, indexing strategy, ETL processing, complex joins and window functions.
* **Outcomes:** ~35% reduction in redundant data storage, eliminated insert/update anomalies, and built a foundation for scalable Power BI reporting.

#### 5. Highly Available Job Posting System on AWS
* **Goal:** Architected and deployed a fault-tolerant, secure web-based job posting system simulating enterprise-grade cloud environments.
* **Tech & Architecture:** AWS VPC, ALB, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch.
* **Outcomes:** Validated 99% uptime under simulated load and manual EC2 termination. Maintained transaction consistency with zero orphan records under concurrent writes.

#### 6. Real-Time Ball Tracking Game Engine (Computer Vision)
* **Goal:** Developed a real-time procedural game engine system where physical object movement via webcam acts as the controller.
* **Tech & Architecture:** OpenCV (Python), Unity 3D (C#), physics-based rigidbody logic, procedural platform generation.
* **Outcomes:** Successfully solved real-time signal mapping, smoothed out coordinate jitter, and integrated a cross-language pipeline for responsive gameplay.

#### 7. Large-Scale Data Quality & Validation Pipeline
* **Goal:** Designed a structured, repeatable validation pipeline for 500,000+ records to ensure data integrity before analytical reporting.
* **Tech & Concepts:** Schema/Structural/Business Rule validation, data standardization, quality scoring framework.
* **Outcomes:** Drastically reduced manual reconciliation from 8-10 hours per cycle to an automated pipeline, culminating in an audited Power BI reporting layer.
